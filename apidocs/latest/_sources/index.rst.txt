Revlens API Documentation
===================================

Revlens is a hybrid C++ / Python application. A large percentage of functionality is implemented in C++ and exposed to python via binding. Each of the C++ libraries bound to python are available via an autogenerated module name of the form RlpRevlens{SOMETHING}module. You can find these in the :ref:`Module Index<modindex>`.

revlens' main controller object **CNTRL_MainController** is exposed to python via ``revlens.CNTRL`` and autogenerated docs would be at :ref:`RlpRevlensCNTRLmodule<CNTRL_module>`, among the other main controller objects.

The current session object **DS_Session** can be obtained via ``revlens.CNTRL.session()``. see the :ref:`DS_Session object API<revlens_DS_module>` docs for functionality available on the session object.

The "main" public python API for revlens is :ref:`revlens.cmds<revlens_cmds>`.
